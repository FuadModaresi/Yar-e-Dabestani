## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Light desaturated grayish-blue (#E8F0FE) for a calm, focused learning environment. The use case for this app is academic and the content involves the sciences, so an emphasis on neutrality is called for; a light color scheme is chosen for maximum readability.
- Primary color: Soft blue (#6789B2) for key elements like navigation and interactive components. This color harmonizes well with the light blue background and promotes a sense of trust.
- Accent color: Subtle peach (#F2B7A1) to highlight important information and calls to action, creating visual contrast.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for a clear, modern, and accessible reading experience in both headings and body text. The choice of 'PT Sans' helps make on-screen educational content readable and attractive to Iranian high school students.
- Use simple, intuitive icons to represent different subjects and features. Should feel modern, consistent, and not too playful for high school age. Match the color of the soft blue primary.
- Design a clean and structured layout that prioritizes readability and ease of navigation, to avoid any sense of visual clutter and help the student focus on the content. The Persian language support requires careful attention to right-to-left text direction.
- Implement smooth transitions and subtle animations to enhance the user experience without distracting from learning.
