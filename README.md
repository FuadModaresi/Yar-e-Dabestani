## 🏁 Getting Started

To get the project up and running on your local machine, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 20.x or higher)
-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <project-directory>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your Google AI API key:
    ```
    GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_ai_api_key_here
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Run the development server:**
    This command starts the Next.js application.
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

2.  **Run the Genkit development server (in a separate terminal):**
    This command starts the local server for the AI flows, allowing you to test and debug them.
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:watch
    ```

3.  **Open the application:**
    Open [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002) in your browser to see the running application. The Genkit developer UI will be available at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).
